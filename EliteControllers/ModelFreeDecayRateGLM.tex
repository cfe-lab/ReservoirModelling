To estimate the reservoir half life directly from the observed proviral
sequences, we first binned the proviral sequences by their age (from 0 years
old to 1 year old; from 1 year old to 2 years old; etc).  We will refer to the
bin containing proviruses from $t-1$ to $t$ years old as ``bin $t$''.  We make
the simplifying assumptions that all proviruses in bin $t$ are exactly $t$
years old, and that the proviral reservoir is seeded at a constant rate, i.e.\
without any regard to viral dynamics.

We then applied a Poisson generalized linear model with the canonical $\ln$
link function to the binned counts, using the age of the bin $t$ as the
predictor.  This choice can be justified as follows.  Let $t_{1/2}$ be the
proviral half-life.  Assuming the participant's proviral reservoir decays at an
exponential rate, we would expect that the size of bin $t$ would be
approximately
\[
\lfloor C \exp(-\theta t) \rfloor
\]
where $C$ represents the initial size of the age bin as if there was no decay,
and $\theta = \ln(2) / t_{1/2}$.

Now, we assume that every provirus has the same small independent probability
$p$ of being observed through sampling, extraction, and sequencing.  If this is
the case, we would then expect the number of observed proviruses from bin $t$
to be binomially distributed with $\lfloor C \exp(-\theta t) \rfloor$ trials
and success probability $p$.  As we assume that $p$ is small, we can thus
approximate the distribution with a Poisson distribution with parameter
\[
\lambda = Cp \exp(-\theta t) = \exp(D - \theta t)
\]
where $D = \ln(Cp)$, or in other words
\[
\ln \lambda = D - \theta t.
\]
This is thus precisely the setup required for the
aforementioned Poisson generalized linear model with $\ln$ link function.
